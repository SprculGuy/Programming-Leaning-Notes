Types of cloud services
    public 	- Owned and operated by provider(AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP) which provide cloud services over the internet based on Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
    private - single organization that work on private infrastructure(on-premises or hosted by a third-party provider) suitable for high security and compliance requirements.
    hybrid 	- Combines public and private cloud infrastructures.Provides flexibility and scalability while maintaining control over sensitive data.

AWS Services
	Account Management 
		• Root user privileges
			• Root user = Account Owner (created when the account is created) who has complete access to all AWS services and resources
			• Lock away your AWS account root user access keys and do not use the root account for everyday tasks, even administrative tasks
			• Actions that can be performed only by the root user:
				• Change account settings(account name, email address, root user password, root user access keys)
				• Close your AWS account
				• Change or cancel your AWS Support plan
				• Register as a seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace(seller example, in case you own reserved instance that is not needed anymore)
				• View certain tax invoices
				• Restore IAM user permissions
				• Configure an Amazon S3 bucket to enable MFA
				• Edit or delete an Amazon S3 bucket policy that includes an invalid VPC ID or VPC endpoint ID
				• Sign up for GovCloud


		• To Access AWS
			1. AWS management Console (protected by password + MFA(via Virtual/Physical MFA device)) - Web Interface
			2. AWS CLI (Protected by Access Keys) - access keys are single time given credentials(id and secret key) to access AWS services from terminal of our PC
			3. AWS SDK (for application code(coding language specific): protected by access keys) - access and manage AWS services programmatically embedded within application

			Note - Access keys are generated through AWS Management Console
					Access Key Id (like username)
					Access Key (like secret password)


		AWS IAM(IAM Identity and Access Management) - Global service (For trusted users and belong to your company)
				- create users(of your org) and assign them to user access groups(according to department) inside AWS
				- JSON document called policies are used to define the permissions for users/group/role
                - Free to use

				IAM Policy structure - 
					- consists of -
						"Version": policy language version, generally we use "2012-10-17"
						"Id": an identifier for the policy(optional)
						"Statement" : one or more individual statements (required)
							Statement consist of - 
								"Sid" : identifier for statement(optional)
								"Effect" : "Allow" or "Deny", defines the statement whether it allows of denies access to certain APIs
								"Principal" : account/user/role to which this policy applied to
								"Action" : list of actions this policy allows or denies
								"Resource" : list of resources to which the action applied to 
								"Condition" : condition for when this policy is in effect(optional)

					- example policy;
						{
							"Version" : "2012-10-17",
							"Id" : "S3-Account-Permissions",
							"Statement" : [
								{
									"Sid" : "1",
									"Effect" : "Allow",
									"Principal" : {
										"AWS" : ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
									},
									"Action" : [
										"s3:GetObject",
										"s3:PutObject",
										"iam:List*"         // allows all list___ operations on IAM using this policy
									],
									"Resource" : ["arn:aws:s3::mybucket/*"],
									"Condition" : 
								}
							]
						}

				IAM Roles -
					- Assigning specific permissions for the AWS services/accounts/external Web Identity for accessing AWS resources
					- Roles provide temporary security credentials(not userid/pass) to whomever has the ability to assume that role

				IAM Security Tools(Audit permissions of accounts)
					IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
						- a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

					IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
						- Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed by users.

					IAM Access Analyzer
						- Find out which resources are shared externally(Access outside zone of trusts) and provides findings
							• S3 Buckets
							• IAM Roles
							• KMS Keys
							• Lambda Functions and Layers
							• SQS queues
							• Secrets Manager Secrets
						- Define Zone of Trust = AWS Account or AWS Organization

				IAM User Group
					- IAM User Groups can contain only IAM Users




	Advanced Identity
		AWS Organizations (to manage multi account)
			- Global Service used to manage multiple child accounts under single Master/Management account
			- Service Control Policies(SCP) - centrally manage all IAM users, groups, and roles, including the AWS account root user in your AWS Organization
			- Cost Benefits
				• consolidated billing across all accounts(no need to add payment method for all accounts)
				• aggregated usage results pricing benefits(volume discount for EC2, S3, etc.)
				• effective sharingly usage of reserved EC2 instances for optimal savings
			- API is available to automate AWS account creation
				• Defaultly everything is restricted, have to explicitly Allow account privileges
				• Allow or Deny IAM actions(privileges) applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root/Admin user
				• Does not apply to the Master Account and service-linked roles(enables AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations)
				• Use case; restrict access to certain services, enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services
			- Consolidated Billing
				• Combined Usage – combine the usage across all AWS accounts in the AWS Organization to share the volume pricing, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discounts
				• One Bill – get one bill for all AWS Accounts in the AWS Organization
			- management account can turn off Reserved Instances discount sharing for any account in the AWS Organization, including itself
			- Multi Account strategies
				• Create account(Organizational Units);
					- per department
					- per cost center
					- per environment(dev/test/prod)
					- based on regulatory restrictions(using SCP)
					- for better resource isolation(eg. VPC)
					- to have separate per-account service limits
					- isolated account for logging
				• Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
				• Use tagging standards for billing purposes
				• Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account as well as send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account


		AWS Control Tower
			- gives ability to easily set-up and govern a secure and compliant multi-account AWS environment based on best practices
				• Automate the set up of your environment in a few clicks
				• Automate ongoing policy management using Control Tower Guardrail(governance rules on OU to enforce policies or detect violations)
				• Detect policy violations and remediate them
				• Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard
			- Runs on top of AWS Organizations; automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts and implement SCPs(Service Control Policies)


        AWS Resource Access Manager(RAM)
            - Share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts, whether they're in your organization or not
            - Helps to avoid resource duplication!
            - Supported resources include Aurora DB, VPC Subnets, Transit Gateway, Route 53, EC2 Dedicated Hosts, License Manager Configurations, etc.


        AWS Service Catalog
            - Users that are new to AWS have too many options, and may create stacks that are not compliant/in-line with the rest of the organization
            - Provides quick self-service portal(instructions) to launch a set of authorized products pre-defined by admins; Includes: virtual machines, databases, storage options, etc.
            - Admins pre-configure the Cloudformation templates and gives specific permissions to access and use those templates portfolio


        AWS STS(Security Token Service)
            - Create temporary, limited privileges credentials(access key, session key) to access your AWS resources
            - Short-term credentials: configurable expiration period
            - Use cases
                • IAM Roles for cross/same account access
                        IAM Role(same/cross account)                    ==(assume role)==>                      
                                    User                         <==(temporary security credentials)==                   AWS STS 
                • Identity federation: manage user identities in external systems, and provide them with STS tokens to access AWS resources
                • IAM Roles for Amazon EC2: provides temporary credentials for EC2 instances to access AWS resources


		Amazon Cognito
			• Database of users for your Web and Mobile applications users(potentially millions) with redirected sign-in of Facebook, Google, and Twitter
			• Instead of creating them an IAM user, you create a user in Cognito


		AWS Directory Services
			- Microsoft Active Directory (AD) : doesn't belong to AWS
				• On Windows Server that has AD domain services, AD is a central system that manages users and their access to network resources
				• Handles logins and permissions, making network administration easier
				• AD is way for you to manage users, computers, printers, file shares, security groups and so on, usually within on-premises system

			- 3 types of AD available in AWS
				• AWS Managed Microsoft AD	
					- Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
					- Establish “trust” connections with your onpremise AD
				• AD Connector
					- Directory Gateway(proxy) to redirect to onpremise AD, supports MFA
					- Users are managed on the on-premise AD
				• Simple AD
					- AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
					- Cannot be joined with on-premise AD


		AWS IAM Identity Center (formarly AWS Single Sign-On)
			- managing users across many accounts in a central manner instead of managing it per account basis
			- one login for multiple AWS accounts & business applications;
				• AWS accounts in AWS Organizations
				• Business cloud applications(e.g., Salesforce, Box, Microsoft 365, etc.)
				• SAML2.0-enabled applications
				• EC2 Windows Instances
			- Identity providers - user pool
				• Built-in identity store in IAM Identity Center
				• 3rd party: Active Directory(AD), OneLogin, Okta


		Amazon WorkSpaces
			- Managed Desktop as a Service(DaaS-fully managed VDI and desktop) solution to easily provision Windows or Linux desktops
			- Great to eliminate management of on-premise VDI(Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)
			- Fast(Regional-should be provisioned close to users Region) and quickly scalable to thousands of users
			- Secured data – integrates with KMS
			- Pay-as-you-go on-demand service with monthly or hourly rates


		Amazon AppStream 2.0
			- Desktop Application Streaming Service - Stream a desktop application to web browsers (no need to connect to a VDI)
			- Deliver to any computer(that has a web browser), without acquiring, provisioning infrastructure as application is delivered from within a web browser
			- Allow to configure an instance type per application type (CPU, RAM, GPU)




	Billing
        Pricing Models in AWS
            - AWS has 4 pricing models;
                • Pay as you go : pay for what you use, remain agile, responsive, meet scale demands
                • Save when you reserve : minimize risks, predictably manage budgets, comply with long-terms requirements
                    - Reservations are available for 
                        EC2 Reserved Instances

                        RDS Reserved Instance
                        Redshift Reserved Nodes
                • Pay less by using more : volume-based discounts
                • Pay less as AWS infrastructure and usage grows

            - Free services & free tier in AWS
                - IAM
                - VPC
                - Consolidated Billing

				• Recommended to use Private IP instead of Public IP for good savings and better network performance
				• Use same AZ for maximum savings(trade-of with high availability)
				• Charges for IPv4 address creation;
					- For all AWS services(except EC2) starting from 1st Feb 2024, all public IPv4 created(to access your services like s3 hosted static website) in a account
					- $0.005 per hour of public IPv4 (~$3.6 per month)
					- For new accounts in AWS, you have a free tier for the EC2 service: 750 hours of AWS charges for PM IPv4 per month for 12 months

					Note - to monitor pulic IP address in use : "Amazon VPC IP Address Manager" -> "Public IP insights"

	Architecting & Ecosystem
		• Well Architected Framework General Guiding Principles
			- Stop guessing your capacity needs - use auto scaling and scale the based on what the actual demand on your system is going to be
			- Test systems at production scale
			- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier 
				• CloudFormation;  infrastructure as code can easily create an architecture on different accounts and different regions
				• BeanStalk;  platform as a service
			- Allow for evolutionary architectures - design based on changing requirements. for example, make serverless designs(Developers don’t have to manage/provision servers instead it's managed/provisioned by AWS)
			- Drive architectures using data - choose architecture and services based on actual usage, patterns, queries and what you actually need based on this data
			- Improve through game days - Simulate applications for flash sale days for sudden stike of traffic, failover simulation


		AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles
			Scalability: ability to accommodate a larger load
				1. Vertical Scalability 
					- flexible size/capacity of instance
					- scale up/down(elasticity)
				2. Horizontal Scalability 
					- flexible number of instances, parallel execution
					- scale out/in using ASG and ELB
					- High Availability is must, run instances of same application across multi AZ
			Agility: gives ability make users work faster as creation and deletion happens qickly
			Disposable Resources: servers should be easily disposable & easily configurable
			Automation: use Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling, etc.
			Loose Coupling: Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled(independant) components
			Services, not Servers: Refrain using EC2, use managed services(serverless), databases, etc.


		Well-Architected Framework 6 Pillars
			1. Operational Excellence
				- Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
				- Design Principles;
					• Perform operations as code - Infrastructure as code, i.e. make use of Cloudformation
					• Make frequent, small, reversible changes - So that in case of any failure, you can reverse it
					• Refine operations procedures frequently and ensure that team members are familiar with it
					• Anticipate failure
					• Learn from all operational failures
					• Use managed(serverless) services - to reduce operational burden
					• Implement observability for actionable insights - performance, reliability, cost, etc.
			2. Security
			3. Reliability  : Testing recovery procedures, stopping guessing capacity, and managing changes in automation
			4. Performance Efficiency   : democratize advanced technologies, go global in minutes, use serverless architecture, experiment more often, mechanical sympathy
			5. Cost Optimization
			6. Sustainability

			Note; They are not something to balance or trade-offs, they’re a reccomandations

	Cloud Migration Essentials
		Cloud Migration Strategies : The 7Rs
			Retire : Turn off things you don’t need(maybe as a result of Re-architecting) and only focus your attention on resources that must be maintained
				- Helps with reducing the surface areas for attacks(more security) 
				- Save cost, maybe up to 10% to 20%
			
			Retain : filter/shorlist the services for cloud migration
				- because of Security, data compliance, performance, unresolved dependencies
				- No business value to migrate, mainframe or mid-range and non-x86 Unix apps
			
			Relocate : Move apps from on-premises to its Cloud version or move EC2 instances to a different VPC, AWS account or AWS Region
				- Example: transfer servers from VMware Software-defined Data Center(SSDC) to VMware Cloud on AWS
			
			Rehost “lift and shift” : Simple migrations without cloud optimizations, applications is migrated as it is
				- By re-hosting(applications, databases, data) or migrating machines(physical, virtual, another Cloud) to AWS Cloud
				- Could save as much as 30% on cost
				- Example: Migrate using AWS Application Migration Service

			Replatform “lift and reshape” : migrating without changing the core architecture, but leverage some Cloud optimizations
				- Save time and money by moving to a fully managed service or Serverless
				- Example: migrate your database to RDS or migrate your application to Elastic Beanstalk
			
			Repurchase “drop and shop” : Moving to a different product(SaaS platform) while moving to the Cloud
				- Expensive in the short term, but quick to deploy
				- Example: CRM to Salesforce.com, HR to Workday, CMS to Drupal
			
			Refactor/Re-architect : Reimagining how the application is architected using Cloud Native features
				- Driven by the need of the business to add features and improve scalability, performance, security, and agility
				- Move from a monolithic application to micro-services
				- Example: move an application to Serverless architectures, use AWS S3


		AWS Application Discovery Service
			- Plan migration projects by gathering information like Server utilization data and dependency mapping about on-premises data centers
			AWS Agentless Discovery Connector(for Agentless Discovery)
				- gives information about VM inventory, configuration, and performance history such as CPU, memory, and disk usage
			AWS Application Discovery Agent(for Agent-based Discovery)
				- gives lower level of information like System configuration, system performance, running processes, and details of the network connections between systems
			AWS Migration Hub : for AWS DMS(Database Migration Service) & AWS Application Migration Service(MGN)
				- central location to collect server and applications inventory data from AWS Application Discovery Service, for the assessment, planning and tracking of migrations to AWS
				AWS Migration Hub Orchestrator : provides pre-built templates to save time and efforts migrating enterprise apps(eg. SAP, MS SQL server)

	Global Cloud Infrastructure
		• Gives ability to create global application(deployed in multiple geographies - Regions and/or Edge Locations) for 
		• For; Decreased Latency, Disaster Recovery, Attack protection from 
		
		• Global Application Architectures		
			1. Single Region, Single AZ		✕ High Availability;  ✕ Global Latency;   Low Difficulty
			2. Single Region, Multi AZ		✓ High Availability;  ✕ Global Latency;   Modrate Difficulty 
			3. Multi Region, Active-Passive	✓ High Availability;  ✓ Global Reads’ Latency;  ✕ Global Writes’ Latency;   Modrate Difficulty 
			4. Multi Region, Active-Active	✓ High Availability;  ✓ Global Reads’ Latency;  ✓ Global Writes’ Latency;   High Difficulty
		
		• AWS Global infrastructure - https://infrastructure.aws/
			AWS Regions [ Asia Pacific(Mumbai) : ap-south-1, Asia Pacific(Sydney) : ap-southeast-2, US East(Ohio) : us-east-2 ]
					- Geographic areas containing multiple, isolated data centers(Physical facilities housing servers, networking equipment and other infrastructure) 
					- most AWS services are region scoped(service behaves as new if region is changed)
					For launching new application, how should you choose the region?
						- compliance : with gov and legal requirements
						- latency : according to users' locations to give them min latency
						- service availability
						- pricing : vary from region to region

			AWS Availability zones(AZ) [ ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b ap-south-1c ]
					- Each region has at least 3 isolated availability zones(2 or more data centers) connected with high bandwidth ultra-low latency network
					- linked altogether forming a region

			AWS Local Zones [ Kolkata : ap-south-1-ccu-1a, Delhi : ap-south-1-del-1a ]
					- Bring AWS resources (compute(EC2, ECS), database(RDS, ElastiCache), storage(EBS), etc.) closer to your end users for latency-sensitive applications
					- Optional, i.e. must be enabled mannually to extend your VPC to more locations

			AWS WaveLength [ ap-south-1-wl1-mum-wlz-1, ap-south-1-wl1-ccu-wlz-1 ]
					- Brings AWS services(EC2, EBS, VPC, etc.) embedded within the telecommunications providers datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
					- Optional, i.e. must be enabled mannually, without any additional charges or service agreements
					- Ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks as Traffic doesn’t leave the Communication Service Provider’s (CSP) network

			AWS Edge Locations/Points of Presence - AWS has 400+ Points of presence
					- Network infrastructure points strategically located around the world
					- Improve latency and performance for applications and services
					- generally used for Cloudfront Distributions(Global Content Delivery Network)


		AWS Route53 : Global DNS
			- Managed DNS (Domain Name System) to route users to the closest deployment with least latency and disaster recovery strategies
			- In AWS, the most common records are:
				• A record (IPv4)  								|	www.google.com 	=>  12.34.56.78
				• AAAA IPv6 									| 	www.google.com 	=>  2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
				• CNAME: hostname to hostname					| 	search.google.com =>  www.google.com
				• Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc.)	| 	example.com 	=>  AWS resource
			- Routing Policies:
				• Simple routing policy (only one with no health checks) - 	Web browser (foo.example.com) ⇄ (A:11.22.33.44) Route 53
				• Weighted routing policy -	 Route 53  (req)=>  { EC2_1(70%) | EC2_2(20%) | EC2_3(10%) }
				• Latency routing policy - 	Route 53
				• Failover routing policy -  Route 53  (req)=>  { if  healthy_primary:   EC2(primary)  else  EC2(failover) }


		AWS Cloudfront : Global Content Delivery Network
			- Replicates the part of your application to AWS Edge Locations(216 Point of Presence globally) for decreased latency
			- Cache common and frequent requests – improved user experience and decreased latency
			- CloudFront - Origins(locations where your original content is stored)
				• S3 bucket
					- For distributing files(static content) and caching them at the edge; also be used as an ingress(to upload files to S3)
					- Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control(OAC)+S3 bucket-policy replacing old Origin Access Identity (OAI)
					- Cloudfront vs S3 Cross Region Replication	
						• Cloudfront is a Global-CDN with Global TTL-based caching  ||  S3 Replication is a storage service for Regional data availability and disaster recovery	
						• For the static content that must be available everywhere  ||  For the dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
				• Custom Origin (HTTP) 
					- Application Load Balancer
					- EC2 instance
					- S3 website(must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
					- Any HTTP backend you want
			- Security;
				• DDoS protection(because worldwide)
				• integration with Shield
				• AWS Web Application Firewall
			- Pricing;
				• Pricing is different across different geographic regions
				• Number of HTTP/HTTPS requests

				• Data Transfer-Out but not for Transfer-In(volume discount)


		AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration
			- Accelerate global uploads & downloads by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region 
			- File in USA   ==(public WWW)==>   Edge Location in USA   ==(private AWS)==>   S3 Bucket in Asia


		AWS Global Accelerator
			- Improve global application availability and performance by Leveraging the AWS private global network to optimize the route to your applications	
			- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations
			- CloudFront vs Global Accelerator
				• Caches content (images, videos) at global edge locations for faster delivery  ||  proxying packets at the edge to applications in one or more AWS regions, 
				• Reduced upload/download latency  ||  Improves performance for TCP/UDP applications that require static IP addresses and fast regional failover


		AWS Outposts
			- AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own(kind of rented from AWS) applications on-premises
			- "Outposts Racks"(server racks) : AWS will setup and manage within your on-premises infrastructure(Data centers) on which you can start leveraging AWS services
			- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security
			- Benefits;
				• Low-latency access
				• Local data processing
				• Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
				• Fully managed service
			- services that work on Outposts: EC2, EBS(Elastic Block Store), S3, EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service), ECS, RDS, EMR(Elastic MapReduce)




	Cloud Integration
		• When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
		• There are two patterns of application communication
			1. Synchronous communications (application to application)
			2. Asynchronous/Event based (application to queue to application) - scales independantly to handle sudden traffic spikes


		AWS SQS: queue model
			- Fully managed oldest(over 10 years) service, used to decouple applications 
			- Low latency (< 10ms on publish and receive)
			- Scalable from 1 to 10000 messages/sec without any limit on how many messages can be in the queue
			- Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
			- Messages are deleted after they’re read by consumers
			- Working;
				Producers   ==(sending messages)==>   SQS Queue   ==(Polling messages)==>   Consumers(Messages are deleted after they’re read by consumers)
			- Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally
			- Types of SQS Queues;
				1. Standard Queues : for high throughput
				2. FIFO(First-In First-Out) Queue : for ordered, exactly-once processing
			- Dead-Letter Queues(DLQs) used to isolate and analyze messages that have failed to be processed after a certain number of attempts


		AWS SNS(Simple Notification Service):  topic(publish/subscribe) model i.e. send one message to many receivers
			- The “Publishers” only sends message to one SNS topic but each Subscriber to the topic will get all the sent messages
			- No message retention
			- Working
				Publisher   ==(message)==>   SNS Topic   ==(all messages)==>   Subscribers(SQS, Lambda, Data Firehose, HTTP/S endpoints, Emails, Mobile Sms and Notifications)
			- Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic, 100,000 topics limit


		AWS Kinesis Data Streams: real-time big data streaming model
			- Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data with low latency from hundreds of thousands of sources(at any scale)
			AWS Data Firehose: load Kinesis Data Streams into Amazon S3, Redshift, OpenSearch, etc.


		AWS MQ
			- SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services:proprietary protocols from AWS but Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols(MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS)
			- When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ 
			- Managed message broker service for Rabbit MQ, Active MQ and doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS/SNS 
			- Runs on servers, so best practice is to run in Multi-AZ with failover
			- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)


		AWS Pinpoint
            - Scalable 2-way(outbound+inbound) personalize marketing communications service via email, sms, push notification, voice with support of receving replies
			- Use Case: run campaign, bulk transactional SMS message
			- create message templates, delivery schedules, highly-targeted segments; unlike SNS & SES where we need to manage each message's audience, content, and delivery schedule




	Cloud Monitoring
		• Visualize the performance of our cloud deployments

		AWS CloudWatch
			- collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms for cloud and on-premises servers
			CloudWatch Metrics - for every services in AWS	
				- Monitors CPU-Utilization, Networking mapped with Timestamps
				- We can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics
				- Important Metrics
					• EC2 instances: CPU Utilization, Status Checks, Network (not RAM)
						- Default metrics every 5 minutes
						- Option for Detailed Monitoring ($$$): metrics every 1 minute
					• EBS volumes: Disk Read/Writes
					• S3 buckets: BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests
					• Billing: Total Estimated Charge (only in us-east-1)
					• Service Limits: how much you’ve been using a service API
					• Custom metrics: we create and push your own metrics

			CloudWatch Alarms
				- Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any CloudWatch metric fall outside thresh-hold(sampling, %, max, min, etc.) limit with 3 status: "OK", "INSUFFICIENT_DATA", "ALARM"
				- Alarms actions for thresh-hold hit;
					• for Auto Scaling : increase or decrease EC2 instances “desired” count
					• for EC2 Actions : stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance
					• for SNS notifications : send a notification into an SNS topic
					• for CloudWatch Billing metric : Billing alarm

			CloudWatch Logs
				- A single, highly scalable service that centralizes the real-time monitoring of logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use
				- Adjustable CloudWatch Logs retention even for infinite period of time 
				- Collect logs from these services by assigning IAM permissions to the services which will allows these services to send logs in CloudWatch
					• EC2 or on-premises servers : with the help of small hybrid agent software; CloudWatch log agent
					• Elastic Beanstalk : collection of logs from application
					• ECS : collection from containers
					• AWS Lambda : collection from function logs
					• CloudTrail based on filter
					• Route53 : Log DNS queries

	Cloud Networking
		• IP Addresses in AWS
			- IPv4 : Internet Protocol version 4 (4.3 Billion Addresses)
				- All public IPv4 on AWS will be charged $0.005 per hour(includes Elastic IP)
				• Public IPv4 
					- used on the Internet
					- By default, EC2 instance gets a new a public IP address every time you restart
				• Private IPv4
					- Used on private networks(LAN) such as internal AWS networking (e.g. 192.168.1.1)
					- Private IPv4 is fixed for EC2 Instances even if you start/stop them
				• Elastic IP 
					- allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to EC2 instance
			- Monitor pulic IP address in use : "Amazon VPC IP Address Manager" -> "Public IP insights"

			- IPv6 : Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 × 10!" Addresses)
				• Every IP address is public in AWS (no private range)
				• Example IPv6 address: 2001:db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff
				• Free to use/expose services on internet

		• Classic ports to know
			21 = FTP(File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
			22 = SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol)
			80 = HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - access unsecured websites
			433 = HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) - access secured websites
			22 = SSH(Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
			3389 = RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a windows instance


		AWS VPC(virtual private cloud)  - regional resource
			- private virtual network to deploy your resources dedicated to your AWS account in specific region
			- VPC CIDR range: 172.31.0.0/16 - range of IP addresses that are allowed within VPC; 172.31.0.0/16 => 172.31.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 total of 65,536 IP addresses

			Subnet  - Availability Zone resource
				- allow you to partition your network inside your VPC according to Availability Zones 
				- In default VPC all subnets are public
				- Partition services on;
					• public subnet is accessible from the internet using route to the Internet Gateways of VPC - used for Load Balancer, EC2, etc.
					• private subnet is not accessible from the internet - used for RDS, etc.
						- Use NAT Gateways(AWS-managed) & NAT Instances(self-managed) for instances in private subnet that need access to Internet for OS updates, file downloading, etc. 
						- for Internet connectivity, create a route from the private subnets to the NAT Gateway, and from the NAT Gateway to the Internet Gateway

			Internet Gateway
				- VPC can only have one Internet Gateway 
				- for instances in public subnet to get accessed from/to Internet

			NAT Gateways(AWS-managed)/NAT Instances(self-managed)
				- for instances in private subnet that need access to Internet while still remaining private

			Route Tables  
				- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables

			Network security
				- by allowed/deny inbound/outbound traffic
				- Two types;
					• Network ACL(subnet level) ; Stateless, Firewall which controls inbound/outbound subnet traffic 
					• Security Groups(instance level) ; Statefull Firewall that controls traffic to/from an EC2 Instance

			Flow Logs
				- Helps to monitor filterd IP traffic going into your interfaces & troubleshoot connectivity issues 
				- Also Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces. like, Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc.
				- logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon Data Firehose

			Peering Connections
				- Connect two VPC privately using AWS network to behave as if they were in the same network
				- Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
				- Peering connection must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another. i.e. vpcA ⇄ vpcB | vpcA ⇄ vpcC | vpcB ⇄ vpcC

			Endpoints
				- allow you to connect to AWS Services from VPC using a private network instead of the public www network, with enhanced security and lower latency
				- Types
					• VPC Endpoint Gateway: for only S3 & DynamoDB 
					• VPC Endpoint Interface(ENI): most services(including S3 & DynamoDB)
				AWS PrivateLink
					- To privately connect service running within your VPC to other VPC on other account directly, without requiring VPC peering, internet/NAT gateway, route tables
					- Requires a network load balancer(Service/accessed VPC) and ENI(Customer/accessing VPC)

			Hybrid VPC
				- To connect on-premises data center to the VPC
				- Two options;
					• Site to Site VPN
						- Connect an on-premises(using Customer Gateway-CGW) VPN to AWS VPC(using Virtual Private Gateway-VGW) 
							On-premise DataCenter ⇄ CGW   ==(public WWW)==>   Site to Site VPN(Encrypted)   ==(private AWS)==> VGW ⇄ VPC
						- The connection is automatically encrypted.
						- Goes over the public internet so it will have limited bandwidth and security concerns
					• Direct Connect (DX)
						- Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
						- Goes over a private network so connection is private, secure, fast and reliable
						- Costlier and takes at least a month to establish

			AWS Client VPN
				- Connect from your computer using AWS Client VPN(OpenVPN) to your private network in AWS and on-premises
				- Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP (just as if you were in the private VPC network)
 				- connection goes over public Internet

			Transit Gateway
				- One single Gateway to provide peering between thousands of VPC, on-premises DC(Direct Connect Gateway), VPN connections in star topology

		CloudFront and Route 53:
			- Ensures availability using global edge network
			- Combined with AWS Shield, provides attack mitigation at the edge

			Security Groups
				- network security of EC2(s) which controls how traffic is allowed inbound or outbound of our EC2 instances
				- by default, all INBOUND traffic is BLOCKED, and all OUTBOUND traffic is AUTHORISED
				- it's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
				- we can refer another/multiple security group in new/one security group

				note - if application is not accessible due to (time out), then it's a security group issue

			EC2 accessing Options - 
				1. SSH(Secure Shell/Secure Socket Shell) - by opening inbound port 22 and use SSH keys with terminal
						- refers to the cryptographic network protocol and to the suite of utilities that implement that protocol.
						- used to connect inside of your servers to perform some maintenance or action.
						- SSH is widely used by network administrators to manage systems and applications remotely using cmd

						Command to enter SSH in AWS EC2 Instance -
						> ssh -i <ppm file location> ec2-user@<Public IPv4 address>            // > ssh -i .\first-instance.pem ec2-user@35.154.197.67

				2. EC2 Instance Connect -	by opening inbound port 22; don't need SSH key

				3. AWS Session Manager - by adding IAM role to EC2 instance for AWS Systems Manager
						- Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and on-premises server without SSH access enabled(port 22 opening), bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
						- Send session log data to S3 or CloudWatch Logs

			EC2 Purchasing Option
				- On-Demand - short-term un-interrupted workload, predictable pricing, pay by second

					2. Convertible Reserved Instance - long workload with flexible instances, change instance attributes
				- Saving Plans - minimum committed amount of usage, locked instance family & AWS region but size flexible(micro,small)
				- Spot Instances - cheapest, lose instance because of bid; short & failure resilient workload
				- Spot Fleet - set of Spot Instances and optionally On-demand Instances allows you to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price
				- Dedicated Hosts - most expensive, books entire physical server, gives lower level hardware access, good for companies with high compliance needs or use own software licenses
				- Dedicated Instances - instance running on dedicated hardware, no control over instance placement 
				- Capacity Reservation - reserved in specific AZ for any duration, no matter you use or not you have to pay all, short-term un-interrupted workload

			EC2 Storage
				Elastic Block Store(EBS) Volumes (AZ specific - using snapshot(back-up + restore) we can move to another AZ)
					- network drive(not physical) attached to instance when they run
					- persists data even after instance termination
					- mounted to only one EC2 instance at a time (Foundational Practitioner level) (for associate level - "multi-attach" feature for io1 and io2 EBS Volumes)
					- multiple EBSs can be attached to single instance, as well as EBS can be left unattached
					- have provisioned capacity and performance - size in GB and IOPS(I/O operation per second) 
					- EBS Snapshot
						- moved to EBS Snapshot Archive(75% cheaper) according to setting assigned to archive tier or manual moving but restoring archive to EBS will takes 24 to 72 hours
						- Recycle Bin for EBS snapshot with specified retention(from 1 day to 1 year)
					- pricing(I/O operation per second - performance of volume);
						• Volume type (based on performance)
						• Storage volume in GB per month provisionned(eg. 100 GB), regardless of we use it or not
						• IOPS:
							- General Purpose SSD: Included
							- Provisioned IOPS SSD: Provisionned amount in IOPS
							- Magnetic: Number of requests
						• Snapshots:
							- Added data cost per GB of snapshot per month
						• Data transfer:
							- Outbound data transfer are tiered for volume discounts
							- Inbound is free

				Local EC2 Instance Store
					- Temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance
					- better I/O performance and high disk performance as High performance disk physically attached to Instance
					- if instance with instance store stopped/terminated, storage is lost 
							therefore cannot be used as long term storage of data, e.g. buffer, cache, temp data
					- Risk of data loss if H/W fails, so Backup and Replication should be done 

				Elastic File System(EFS) - managed network file system (multi-Availability Zone storage)
					- can be mounted on 100s of instances using EFS Mount Target unlike EBS
					- scalable, highly expensive, pay per use

				- for faster boot/configuration time because all software will be available pre-packaged on instance through AMI
                - AMI must be in the same region as that of the Amazon EC2 instance to be launched, AMI can be copied to the region where you want to launch the EC2 instance
				EC2 Image Builder' AWS service used to automatically build, test & distribute AMI

			ELB(Elastic Load Balancing)    
				- AWS managed servers that forward traffic to multiple EC2 instances(servers)
				- used across multiple AZ
				- Types 
					1. Application Load Balancer(HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC only traffic, static DNS) - Layer 7
					2. Network Load Balancer( TCP/UDP/TLS traffic with ultra high performance, static IP) - Layer 4
					3. Gateway Load Balancer(Route traffic to firewalls, GWLB protocol) - Layer 3 
						- inspect traffic via 3rd party virtual appliances before taking response to instance

			ASG(Auto Scale Group) 
				- implement elasticity(auto scale up and down based on demand) for application across multiple AZ  
				- integrates with ELB(automatically register new instances to load balancer) as well as replace unhealthy instances
				- Scaling Strategies
					- Manual 
					- Dynamic
						1. Simple/Step Scaling - according to CloudWatch alarm trigger (CPU > 70% -> add instance | CPU < 30% -> remove instance)
						2. Target Tracking Scaling - defined target avg ASG CPU to stay around 60%

	Storage
		AWS S3(infinitely scaling storage/Simple Storage Service) (region specific)
			- Used for 
				- Backup and storage
				- Disaster recovery(by storing on multiple regions)
				- Archive 
				- Hybrid Cloud Storage
				- Application Hosting
				- Media Hosting
				- Big Data Analytics

			- S3 allows to store objects(files) in Buckets(directories)
				Bucket(directory)
					- Buckets have globally unique name across all regions and accounts even if bucket is actually only scoped to specific region
					- Bucket Naming convention
						- no uppercase letter
						- no '_'
						- 3-63 character long
						- should not be IP
						- must start with letter or number
						- must not start with prefix 'xn--' and not end with suffix '-s3alias'
				Object(files)
					- Consists of 
						Key(full path with filename)    eg. s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
						Object Value
							- max object size is 5TB
							- if object is greater than 5GB, must use 'multi-part upload' for several parts
						Metadata(list of key-value pairs, set by system/user)
						Tags(Unicode key-value pair) 
							- max 10
							- useful for security/lifecycle
						Version Id(if versioning enabled)

					- S3 presigned url - signature to verify the request which has credentials encoded

			- Security in S3
				User Based 
					IAM Policies - which API call should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
				Resource Based 
					Bucket Policies
						- to grant Public Access to bucket 
						- Force objects to be encrypted
						- allows cross account(IAM user in another AWS account)
					Object ACL(Access Control List) 
					Bucket ACL(Access Control List)
				Encryption 
					- Encrypt objects using encryption keys
					- Server side encryption is always ON by default, i.e. uploaded unencrypted object is going to be encrypted by AWS S3
					- Client side encryption is also possible and is optional
				Monitoring - IAM Access Analyzer for S3

				Note -     
					IAM users(Acc) -> IAM Policy
					EC2(services) -> IAM Role
					Cross-Account -> Bucket Policy

			Versioning
				- versioning is for objects, but enabled at Bucket-Level
				- Easy rollback
				- Avoid unintended deletion
				- Files prior to enabling versioning will have version 'null'
				- Suspending(turning off) versioning doesn't delete previous versions

			Replication
				- Versioning must be enabled as well as proper IAM Permissions should be given for both(source & target) buckets
				- Copying is asynchronous/background
				- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
                - Only new objects are replicated after you enable Replication. optionally, we can replicate existing obj(including delete markers) using S3 Batch Replication
                - Deletion with VersionId are not replicated to avoid malicious deletes
                - there is not replication chaining. i.e. bkt A has replication into bkt B, which has replication to bkt C then objects of A are not replicated to C
				- Two types of replication:
					1. Cross-Region Replication(CRR)
                        Use Case;
						- compliance
                            - lower latency access(to other region user)

					2. Same-Region Replication(SRR)
                        Use Case;
                            - log aggregation across multiple S3 buckets
						- live replication between production and test accounts 

			Storage Class
				- Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations	
				- Durability:	Same for all storage classes
					• High durability (99.999999999%, 11 9’s) of objects across multiple AZ
					• If you store 10,000,000 objects with AWS S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
				- Availability:	Varies depending on storage class
					• Measures how readily available a service is
					• Example: S3 standard object has 99.99% availability. i.e. not available 53 minutes a year(accessing object will give random error)
				- types:
					1. AWS S3 Standard - General Purpose
						- Object has 99.99% availability
						- User for low latency frequently accessed data
						- sustain the concurrent loss of data.
								i.e. data is recoverable even if multiple physical locations experience simultaneous failures (e.g., natural disasters, power outages)
					2. Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
						- data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
						- Lower cost than S3 Standard for storage & will cost on data retrieval therefore use case is disaster recovery, back-ups
						- Object has 99.99% availability
					3. One Zone-Infrequent Access (IZ-IA)
						- data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
						- Lower cost than S3 Standard for storage & will cost on data retrieval.
						- Data lost when AZ is destoryed where data was stored
						- Object has 99.5% availability(99.99% in single AZ)
						- Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate
					4. Glacier Instant Retrieval
						- Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup with pricing for storage + object retrieval cost
						- Millisecond Retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
						- Minimum storage duration of 90 days. i.e. duration that you pay for the service even if you don't utilize it for the entire 90 days
					5. Glacier Flexible Retrieval
						- Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup with pricing for storage + object retrieval cost
						- Retrieval : Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free
						- Minimum storage duration of 90 days
					6. Glacier Deep Archive - for long term storage and is cheapest
						- Low-cost object storage meant for archiving / backup with pricing for storage + object retrieval cost
						- Retrieval : Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
						- Minimum storage duration of 180 days
					7. Intelligent Tiering
						- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee to moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
						- There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
						• Frequent Access tier (automatic): 		default tier
						• Infrequent Access tier (automatic): 		objects not accessed for 30 days
						• Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): 	objects not accessed for 90 days
						• Archive Access tier (optional): 			configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
						• Deep Archive Access tier (optional): 		configurable from 180 days to 700+ days
