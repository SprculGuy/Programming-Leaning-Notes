    https or http               -> Protocol 
    github.com                  -> domain name
    sprculguy/programming.git   -> resourse



Steps for any host request to the server
    1. DNS lookup
        - checks for server address using domain name. i.e. https://github.com/sprculguy/programming.git  >>  https://123.123.123.123:443/sprculguy/programming.git
    2. TCS/IP socket connection establishment between host and server
        - Breaks data into packets, which are then routed to the destination and reassembled. 
        - TCP is responsible for reliable data delivery, while IP handles addressing and routing the packets 
    3. HTTP request
        http request example -
            GET /sprculguy/programming.git HTTP/1.1     | -> start line: HTTP method + request target + HTTP version
            Host: www.google.com                        |
            User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0                     | -> HTTP request headers
            Accept-Language: en-US                      |
            <BODY>                                      | -> Request body(only when sending data to the server.e.g. HTTP method POST)
    4. HTTP response
        http response example -
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK                             | -> start line: HTTP version + status code + status message
            Date: Fri, 18 Jan 2021                      |
            Content-Type: text/html                     | -> HTTP response headers
            Transfer-Encoding: chunked                  |
            <BODY>                                      | -> Response body



Hosts 
    - Any devices that sends & receives trffic; eg. client, server.
    - Any Host needs 4 things for Internet connectivity
        1. IP address           - Identity (192.168.0.1)
        2. Subnet Mask          - Defines size/scope of local network
        3. Default Gateway      - Routers IP address
        4. DNS server IP address- Gives domain names to IP address
        - DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server - provides configuration(IP,SM,DG,DNS) dynamically for host to connect to the Internet



Protocols
    - Set of rules & messages that forms internet standard
        eg. ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) - Resolves IP to Mac address mapping
            HTTP(Web server)
            HTTPS(HTTP with SSL(SecureSocketLayer)/TSL(TransportLayerSecurity))
            DNS(Domain Name System) server



DNS(Domain Name Server)
    - special kind of Server with stored domain name and address mapping



HTTP Web Server Request Methods
    GET         Read data
    DELETE      Delete data
    POST        Insert data
    PUT         Update data(all fields)
    PATCH       Modify data(Partially - some of the all fields but not all)
    HEAD        Inspect resource headers
    TRACE       Echo back received message
    Options     Server Capabilities



CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) - Security mechanism that allows web applications to access resources from other domains
    - CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.
    - CORS allows the client browser to check with the third-party servers if the request is authorized before any data transfers.
